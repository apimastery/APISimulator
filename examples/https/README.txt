HTTPS Examples README
=====================

The old way of configuring HTTPS using a simulation-specific sim.properties
file is deprecated. Simulations using it will still run but support for it
will be removed in the near future.

See the online documentation at apisimulator.io for how to configure HTTPS
using command line arguments.


Happy API Simulating!
