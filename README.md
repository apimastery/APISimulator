# API Simulator

API Simulator is a configuration-driven tool for developers and testers for modeling and running API simulations - simulations that imitate real APIs or that stub and mock APIs not built yet. Visit [API Simulator's web site](http://apisimulator.io) for more info.

This repository will contain the open source components as we make them available.


Happy API Simulations!
